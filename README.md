User Guide: Starting Your Django Project
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed
Internet connection to install dependencies
Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone your Django project repository to your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-directory>
Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies. Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:

On Windows:
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
Step 3: Install Project Dependencies
With your virtual environment activated, install the necessary packages using the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Run the Development Server
Start the Django development server:

python manage.py runserver
You should see output similar to:

Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
Step 5: Access the Application
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see your application running.

Common Commands
Run the server: python manage.py runserver
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
